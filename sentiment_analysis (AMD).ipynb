DECLARE ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THOSE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE IF THE NOTE HOLDERS OR THE TRUSTEE UNDER THE INDENTURES GOVERNING OUR NOTES NOTES NOTES OR NOTES OR THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT ACCELERATE THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY THOSE BORROWINGS THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND DELIVERING THE LATEST AND BEST PRODUCTS TO MARKET ON A TIMELY BASIS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING REVENUE GROWTH WE BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE OUR PRODUCT COMPETITIVENESS ARE TIMELY PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRODUCT QUALITY PRODUCT FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES INCLUDING ENABLING STATE OF THE ART VISUAL AND VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCLUDING POWER CONSUMPTION AND BATTERY LIFE RELIABILITY PROCESSOR CLOCK SPEED PERFORMANCE SIZE OR FORM FACTOR SELLING PRICE COST ADHERENCE TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CREATION OF OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY SECURITY AND STABILITY BRAND RECOGNITION AND AVAILABILITY WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTENSE DUE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS OR NEW COMPETITORS OF PRODUCTS THAT MAY PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE OR MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS UNCOMPETITIVE WE MAY ALSO FACE AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY COMPETITORS ESPECIALLY DURING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IN ADDITION OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AND SALES RESOURCES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN SUCH A DECLINING MARKET LEADING TO LOWER PRICES AND MARGINS SOME COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER ACCESS OR RIGHTS TO COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING INTERFACE PROCESSOR AND MEMORY TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE WITH OUR APU PRODUCTS AND OTHER COMPETING SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY HAVE STRONGER POSITIONS IN THESE NEW MARKETS OR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING INDUSTRY TRENDS WE MAY FACE DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAN ANTICIPATED OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES CANADA EUROPE AUSTRALIA AND ASIA WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY WAFER FOUNDRIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA NEARLY ALL PRODUCT ASSEMBLY AND FINAL TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED AT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES OPERATED BY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHINA MALAYSIA AND TAIWAN WE ALSO HAVE INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS INTERNATIONAL SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE WERE IN WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION EXPROPRIATION CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY S OR REGION S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS DIFFICULTIES IN PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING STAFFING AND EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR LAWS CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS OF FUNDS AND OTHER ASSETS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS CHANGES IN FREIGHT AND INTEREST RATES DISRUPTION IN AIR TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR OVERSEAS FACILITIES LOSS OR MODIFICATION OF EXEMPTIONS FOR TAXES AND TARIFFS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U S LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDING EXPORT CONTROL AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT IN ADDITION OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD BE SUBJECT TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES TSUNAMIS FLOODING TYPHOONS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT DISRUPT MANUFACTURING OR OTHER OPERATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OUR SANTA CLARA OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES IN CALIFORNIA THERE MAY BE CONFLICT OR UNCERTAINTY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AN OUTBREAK OF A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE SUCH AS AVIAN INFLUENZA MEASLES OR EBOLA SAFETY ISSUES NATURAL DISASTERS FIRE DISRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS OR GENERAL ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED KINGDOM S REFERENDUM COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BREXIT HAS CREATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ALSO THE EUROPEAN UNION S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE COLLECT PROCESS AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON COMPLIANCE ALSO THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OUR ISSUANCE TO WEST COAST HITECH L P WCH OF WARRANTS TO PURCHASE MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IF AND WHEN EXERCISED WILL DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND THE CONVERSION OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR MAY OTHERWISE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE SIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE WSA SIXTH AMENDMENT WE ISSUED WARRANTS TO WCH TO PURCHASE MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ANY ISSUANCE BY US OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO WCH UPON EXERCISE OF THE WARRANTS WILL DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS ANY SALES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET BY WCH OF ANY SHARES OWNED BY WCH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE ANTICIPATED EXERCISE BY WCH OF THE WARRANTS COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON FEBRUARY WCH SOLD APPROXIMATELY MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND NOTIFIED US IT WOULD EXERCISE ITS WARRANT TO PURCHASE MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL AMOUNT OF MILLION WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE PROCEEDS OF MILLION UPON THE EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT AND ISSUE THE MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO WCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE WARRANT AGREEMENT ALSO THE CONVERSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS THE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE SALE PRICE FOR CONVERSION WAS SATISFIED AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER AND AS A RESULT THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION DURING THE FIRST CALENDAR QUARTER OF ANY SALES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON SUCH CONVERSION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN ADDITION THE EXISTENCE OF THE NOTES MAY ENCOURAGE SHORT SELLING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE THE CONVERSION THEREOF COULD BE USED TO SATISFY SHORT POSITIONS OR THE ANTICIPATED CONVERSION OF THE

PURCHASING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST DEMAND IS EVEN FURTHER COMPLICATED WHEN OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD INDIRECTLY THROUGH DOWNSTREAM CHANNEL DISTRIBUTORS AND CUSTOMERS AS OUR FORECASTS FOR DEMAND ARE THEN BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY MULTIPLE PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE DOWNSTREAM CHANNEL PC AND CONSUMER MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SHORT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WHICH CAN LEAD TO RAPID OBSOLESCENCE AND PRICE EROSION IN ADDITION OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CHANGE THEIR INVENTORY PRACTICES ON SHORT NOTICE FOR ANY REASON WE MAY BUILD INVENTORIES DURING PERIODS OF ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND THE CANCELLATION OR DEFERRAL OF PRODUCT ORDERS OR OVERPRODUCTION DUE TO FAILURE OF ANTICIPATED ORDERS TO MATERIALIZE COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF INVENTORY AND AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GROSS MARGINS FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY A REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OR A REDUCTION IN OUR GROSS MARGIN INCLUDE A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS A PRODUCTION OR DESIGN DEFECT IN OUR PRODUCTS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOR OUR OLDER PRODUCTS AS OUR NEW PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED OR OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR TAKING AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH THEY ARE SOLD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A MARKET DECLINE IN ANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON THE CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS

MICROSOFT XBOX ONE S AND MICROSOFT XBOX ONE X GAME CONSOLE SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE IN ADDITION THE GPU MARKET HAS AT TIMES SEEN ELEVATED DEMAND DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF GPU PRODUCTS TO CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING FOR EXAMPLE OUR GPU REVENUE HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN PART BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET DEMAND FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS CHANGED AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE QUICKLY FOR EXAMPLE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE INSTITUTED RESTRICTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING AND THE VALUATIONS OF THE CURRENCIES AND CORRESPONDING INTEREST IN MINING OF SUCH CURRENCIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE RISKS RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET OUR GPU BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHILE OVERALL GROWTH IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS STABILIZING THE AREAS WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS ARE CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS BASED ON FORESEEING THOSE CHANGES AND MAKING TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM FACTORS THAT SERVE THOSE GROWING SUB SEGMENTS GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKNESS HAVE IN THE PAST IMPACTED THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED PURCHASES WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE

OTHERS CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED OR SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED EVEN IF WE WERE TO PREVAIL ANY LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND WOULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX CLAIMS BY TAX AGENCIES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TAX LAWS ARE DYNAMIC AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS NEW LAWS ARE PASSED AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ARE ISSUED OR APPLIED THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE REDUCTION FROM TO THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE THE TAX REFORM ACT ALSO TRANSITIONS INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDES BASE EROSION PREVENTION MEASURES ON NON U S EARNINGS WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SUBJECTING CERTAIN EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO UNITED STATES TAXATION THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE IN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF ANY TAX AUDITS AND LITIGATION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ASSESSMENT OR LITIGATION THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH TAX PROVISIONS AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CONFLICT MINERALS RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES OUR OPERATIONS AND PROPERTIES HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THE TREATMENT TRANSPORT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE OUR SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS FOR OPERATIONS MAKING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND WASTEWATER ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO OVERSEE OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLIANCE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IF OUR SUPPLIERS VIOLATE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THEM A RANGE OF CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT INCLUDING FINES SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION ALTERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IMPORT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SALES LIMITATIONS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES OR OTHER SANCTIONS SUCH NON COMPLIANCE FROM OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY HIGHER SOURCING COSTS AND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS AND SERVERS BASED ON ENERGY STAR SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION LIMITS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THESE MARKETS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF OR THE SUPERFUND ACT IMPOSE STRICT OR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ON CURRENT AND PREVIOUS OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF REAL PROPERTY FOR THE COST OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY EVEN IF THE OWNER OR OPERATOR DID NOT KNOW OF OR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO ASSESS LIABILITY ON PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TO BE SENT TO DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITIES WHEN SUCH FACILITIES ARE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED SUCH PERSONS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS EVEN IF THEY NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED THE CONTAMINATED FACILITY WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT THREE SUPERFUND SITES IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WE COULD BE NAMED A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT OTHER SUPERFUND OR CONTAMINATED SITES IN THE FUTURE IN ADDITION CONTAMINATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED COULD EXIST AT OUR OTHER FACILITIES UNDER THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF THE SEC ADOPTED DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES THAT USE CONFLICT MINERALS ORIGINATING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO OR ADJOINING COUNTRIES WE CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPING INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF ANY CONFLICT MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AUDITING THE PROCESS AND REPORTING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE SEC IN ADDITION TO THE SEC REGULATION THE EUROPEAN UNION CHINA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE DEVELOPING NEW POLICIES FOCUSED ON CONFLICT MINERALS THAT MAY IMPACT AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ALSO SINCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IS COMPLEX WE MAY FACE REPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY VERIFY THE ORIGINS OF THE SUBJECT MINERALS MOREOVER WE ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES TO SATISFY THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CERTIFIED AS CONFLICT FREE IF WE CANNOT SATISFY THESE CUSTOMERS THEY MAY CHOOSE A COMPETITOR S PRODUCTS THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED NEW POLICIES FOR FEDERAL PROCUREMENT FOCUSED ON ERADICATING THE PRACTICE OF FORCED LABOR AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN ADDITION THE UNITED KINGDOM AUSTRALIA AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ISSUED LAWS THAT REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE OUR POLICY AND PRACTICES FOR IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING FORCED LABOR AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SEVERAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS THE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ALLIANCE HAVE ALSO ISSUED EXPECTATIONS TO ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPACT US WHILE WE HAVE A

COMPARED TO BILLION AS OF DECEMBER WE INTEND THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOWS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTED IN THOSE CHANGES AND HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U S GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES U S GAAP THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ON GOING BASIS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR REVENUE INVENTORIES GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALTHOUGH ACTUAL RESULTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN REASONABLY CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT S EXPECTATIONS THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES OR OUR ESTIMATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS REVENUE RECOGNITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD EFFECTIVE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON THE SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS SELL IN RATHER THAN UPON THE RESALE OF THE PRODUCT BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS SELL THROUGH ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROVISIONS FOR RIGHTS OF RETURN AND PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD PRODUCT HELD BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS REVENUE ALLOWANCES WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ON PRODUCT SALES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE PRICE REDUCTIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVES IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECORDED WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON ACTUAL HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS HISTORICAL ALLOWANCES HISTORICAL PRICE REDUCTIONS MARKET ACTIVITY AND OTHER KNOWN OR ANTICIPATED TRENDS AND FACTORS THESE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT S JUDGMENT AND ACTUAL PROVISIONS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES AND CURRENT PROVISIONS RESULTING IN FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS INVENTORY VALUATION AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE WE EVALUATE OUR ENDING INVENTORIES FOR EXCESS QUANTITIES AND OBSOLESCENCE BASED ON PROJECTED SALES OUTLOOK THIS EVALUATION INCLUDES ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL SALES LEVELS BY PRODUCT AND PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND THESE PROJECTIONS ASSIST US IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IN ADDITION WE WRITE OFF INVENTORIES THAT WE CONSIDER OBSOLETE WE ADJUST THE REMAINING SPECIFIC INVENTORY BALANCES TO APPROXIMATE THE LOWER OF OUR STANDARD MANUFACTURING COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AMONG OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS FORECASTED DEMAND IN RELATION TO THE INVENTORY ON HAND COMPETITIVENESS OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES WHEN DETERMINING OBSOLESCENCE AND REALIZABLE VALUE IF IN ANY PERIOD WE ANTICIPATE FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS TO BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATES ADDITIONAL INVENTORY WRITE DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED AND WOULD BE REFLECTED IN COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE THIS WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN IN THAT PERIOD IF IN ANY PERIOD WE ARE ABLE TO SELL INVENTORIES THAT WERE NOT VALUED OR THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN DOWN IN A PREVIOUS PERIOD RELATED REVENUES WOULD BE RECORDED WITHOUT ANY OFFSETTING CHARGE TO COST OF SALES RESULTING IN A NET BENEFIT TO OUR GROSS MARGIN IN THAT PERIOD GOODWILL WE PERFORM OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR AND IF CERTAIN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS THE ANALYSIS MAY INCLUDE BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN IMPAIRMENT QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATION OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHARE PRICE TRENDS AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND COMPANY SPECIFIC EVENTS WE FIRST ANALYZE QUALITATIVE FACTORS IF WE CONCLUDE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING AMOUNT WE DO NOT PROCEED TO PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS IF NECESSARY CONSIDERS THE INCOME APPROACH WHICH REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE A REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNT RATES AND FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IF WE CONCLUDE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT INCOME TAXES IN DETERMINING TAXABLE INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE APPLIED IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES AND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHICH ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY WE MUST INCREASE OUR CHARGE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE FORM OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE WE CONSIDER PAST PERFORMANCE FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN ADDITION THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX RULES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE ADJUSTMENT OF OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OR OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES IF OUR ESTIMATES OF THESE TAXES ARE GREATER OR LESS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS AN ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFIT OR CHARGE WILL RESULT WE RECOGNIZE THE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BREACHES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY AND SEASONAL SALES PATTERNS THE PROFILE OF OUR SALES MAY BE WEIGHTED DIFFERENTLY DURING THE YEAR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR QUARTERLY SALES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MADE IN THE LAST MONTH OF THE QUARTER THIS UNEVEN SALES PATTERN MAKES PREDICTION OF REVENUE FOR EACH FINANCIAL PERIOD DIFFICULT AND INCREASES THE RISK OF UNANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ADDITION OUR OPERATING RESULTS TEND TO VARY SEASONALLY WITH THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FOR EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY FIRST QUARTER PC PRODUCT SALES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND WITH RESPECT TO OUR SEMI CUSTOM SOC PRODUCTS FOR GAME CONSOLES OUR SALES PATTERN USUALLY REFLECTS HIGHER SALES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS COMPARED TO THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT CREATE AND AFFECT QUARTERLY AND

FOR WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE AND OTHER PURPOSES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES REQUIRE US TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO MAKE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH RELATIVELY LESS DEBT AND INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS WE ENTER INTO SALE AND FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES WHICH ARRANGEMENTS ARE NON RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT THAT AN ACCOUNT DEBTOR FAILS TO PAY FOR CREDIT RELATED REASONS AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR INDEBTEDNESS WE COULD BECOME OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE SUCH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES OR OTHERWISE INCUR LIABILITY TO THE COUNTERPARTIES UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHERE A COMMERCIAL DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN US AND AN ACCOUNT DEBTOR THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON US THAT MAY

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE OR SELL OUR ASSETS AS AN ENTIRETY OR SUBSTANTIALLY AS AN ENTIRETY IN ADDITION THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES TO THE EXTENT THAT ON THE DATE OF SUCH PAYMENT A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT OR WE HAVE NOT HAD AT ALL TIMES DURING THE CONSECUTIVE DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SUCH PAYMENT OR WOULD NOT HAVE ON A PRO FORMA BASIS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO SUCH PAYMENT EXCESS CASH AVAILABILITY AS DEFINED IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT OF AT LEAST MILLION ANY OF OUR FUTURE DEBT AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS IF WE FAIL TO MAKE ANY CASH PAYMENT ON A SERIES OF NOTES WHEN REQUIRED BY THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE IT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER SUCH INDENTURE WHICH IN TURN WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT ALSO CONTAINS VARIOUS COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO AMONG OTHER THINGS MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES AND PERMIT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES FROM INCURRING

CERTAIN BORROWED MONEY PRIOR TO ITS DUE DATE AND ENTER INTO ANY NON ARM S LENGTH TRANSACTION WITH AN AFFILIATE EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS WHEREBY A DEFAULT UNDER ONE AGREEMENT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN CROSS DEFAULTS UNDER AGREEMENTS COVERING OTHER BORROWINGS FOR EXAMPLE THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR ANY FAILURE TO REPAY DEBT WHEN DUE IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF MILLION WOULD CAUSE A CROSS DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURES TO THE EXTENT SUCH DEFAULT WOULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS GOVERNING OUR NOTES NOTES AND NOTES AS WELL AS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT UNDER ANY OF THESE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WOULD PERMIT THE APPLICABLE NOTE HOLDERS OR THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO DECLARE ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THOSE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE IF THE NOTE HOLDERS OR THE TRUSTEE UNDER THE INDENTURES GOVERNING OUR NOTES NOTES OR NOTES OR THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT ACCELERATE THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY THOSE BORROWINGS THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND DELIVERING THE LATEST AND BEST PRODUCTS TO MARKET ON A TIMELY BASIS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING REVENUE GROWTH WE BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE OUR PRODUCT COMPETITIVENESS ARE TIMELY PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRODUCT QUALITY PRODUCT FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES INCLUDING ENABLING STATE OF THE ART VISUAL AND VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCLUDING POWER CONSUMPTION AND BATTERY LIFE RELIABILITY PROCESSOR CLOCK SPEED PERFORMANCE SIZE OR FORM FACTOR SELLING PRICE COST ADHERENCE TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CREATION OF OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY SECURITY AND STABILITY BRAND RECOGNITION AND AVAILABILITY WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTENSE DUE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS OR NEW COMPETITORS OF PRODUCTS THAT MAY PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE OR MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS UNCOMPETITIVE WE MAY ALSO FACE AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY COMPETITORS ESPECIALLY DURING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IN ADDITION OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AND SALES RESOURCES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN SUCH A DECLINING MARKET LEADING TO LOWER PRICES AND MARGINS SOME COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER ACCESS OR RIGHTS TO COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING INTERFACE PROCESSOR AND MEMORY TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE WITH OUR APU PRODUCTS AND OTHER COMPETING SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY HAVE STRONGER POSITIONS IN THESE NEW MARKETS OR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING INDUSTRY TRENDS WE MAY FACE DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAN ANTICIPATED OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

OPERATED BY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHINA MALAYSIA AND TAIWAN WE ALSO HAVE INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS INTERNATIONAL SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE WERE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION EXPROPRIATION CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY S OR REGION S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS DIFFICULTIES IN PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING STAFFING AND EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR LAWS CHANGES IN FOREIGN

UNITED STATES AND OUR OVERSEAS FACILITIES LOSS OR MODIFICATION OF EXEMPTIONS FOR TAXES AND TARIFFS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U S LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDING EXPORT CONTROL AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT IN ADDITION OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD BE SUBJECT TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES TSUNAMIS FLOODING TYPHOONS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT DISRUPT MANUFACTURING OR OTHER OPERATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OUR SANTA CLARA OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES IN CALIFORNIA THERE MAY BE CONFLICT OR UNCERTAINTY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AN OUTBREAK OF A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE SUCH AS AVIAN INFLUENZA MEASLES OR EBOLA SAFETY ISSUES NATURAL DISASTERS FIRE DISRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS OR GENERAL ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED KINGDOM S REFERENDUM COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BREXIT HAS CREATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ALSO THE EUROPEAN UNION S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE COLLECT PROCESS AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON COMPLIANCE ALSO THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS THE CONVERSION OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR MAY OTHERWISE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE CONVERSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS THE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE SALE PRICE FOR CONVERSION WAS SATISFIED AS OF THE END OF MARCH AND AS A RESULT THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION DURING THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER OF ANY SALES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON SUCH CONVERSION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN ADDITION THE EXISTENCE OF THE NOTES MAY ENCOURAGE SHORT SELLING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE THE CONVERSION THEREOF COULD BE USED TO SATISFY SHORT POSITIONS OR THE ANTICIPATED CONVERSION OF THE NOTES INTO CASH AND OR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVING THE ORDERING AND SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US WE TYPICALLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS PURSUANT TO INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE ORDERS WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG TERM SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS EXCEPT THAT ORDERS GENERALLY MUST BE FOR STANDARD PACK QUANTITIES GENERALLY OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS MORE THAN DAYS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT WITHOUT INCURRING SIGNIFICANT FEES WE BASE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS IN PART ON CUSTOMERS ESTIMATES OF DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WHICH MAY NOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE QUANTITY OR TYPE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL WANT IN THE FUTURE OR ULTIMATELY END UP PURCHASING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST DEMAND IS EVEN FURTHER COMPLICATED WHEN OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD INDIRECTLY THROUGH DOWNSTREAM CHANNEL DISTRIBUTORS AND CUSTOMERS AS OUR FORECASTS FOR DEMAND ARE THEN BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY MULTIPLE PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE DOWNSTREAM CHANNEL PC AND CONSUMER MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SHORT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WHICH CAN LEAD TO RAPID OBSOLESCENCE AND PRICE EROSION IN ADDITION OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CHANGE THEIR INVENTORY PRACTICES ON SHORT NOTICE FOR ANY REASON WE MAY BUILD INVENTORIES DURING PERIODS OF ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND THE CANCELLATION OR DEFERRAL OF PRODUCT ORDERS OR OVERPRODUCTION DUE TO FAILURE OF ANTICIPATED ORDERS TO MATERIALIZE COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF INVENTORY AND AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GROSS MARGINS FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY A REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OR A REDUCTION IN OUR GROSS MARGIN INCLUDE A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS A PRODUCTION OR DESIGN DEFECT IN OUR PRODUCTS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOR OUR OLDER PRODUCTS AS OUR NEW PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED OR OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR TAKING AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH THEY ARE SOLD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A MARKET DECLINE IN ANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON THE CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHICH HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED A DECLINE DRIVEN BY AMONG OTHER FACTORS THE ADOPTION OF SMALLER AND OTHER FORM FACTORS INCREASED COMPETITION AND CHANGES IN REPLACEMENT CYCLES THE SUCCESS OF OUR SEMI CUSTOM SOC PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON SECURING CUSTOMERS FOR OUR SEMI CUSTOM DESIGN PIPELINE AND CONSUMER MARKET CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF THE SONY PLAYSTATION SONY PLAYSTATION PRO MICROSOFT XBOX ONE S AND MICROSOFT XBOX ONE X GAME CONSOLE SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE IN ADDITION THE GPU MARKET HAS AT TIMES SEEN ELEVATED DEMAND DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF GPU PRODUCTS TO CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING FOR EXAMPLE OUR GPU REVENUE HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN PART BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET DEMAND FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS CHANGED AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE QUICKLY FOR EXAMPLE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE INSTITUTED RESTRICTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING AND THE VALUATIONS OF THE CURRENCIES AND CORRESPONDING INTEREST IN MINING OF SUCH CURRENCIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE RISKS RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET OUR GPU BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE LICENSES BASED ON THEIR FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO US FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIFE OF THE ASSETS CHANGES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES AND CHANGES TO THE BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY REPRESENT AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO RECORD FUTURE TECHNOLOGY LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN COST OF SALES OF MILLION ON TECHNOLOGY LICENSES RELATED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NO LONGER BEING USED OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL MAY HINDER OUR BUSINESS MUCH OF OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF NUMEROUS QUALIFIED ENGINEERING MARKETING SALES AND EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL COMPETITION FOR HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND OUR COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OUR EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE DESIRED SKILLS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TRAIN AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL NECESSARY FOR OUR BUSINESS THE PROGRESS OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS COULD BE HINDERED AND WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO HELP ATTRACT RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WE

REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERE DOWNTURNS THAT HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONSTANT AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONTINUOUS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRICE EROSION AND DECLINES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN RECENT DOWNTURNS DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMBALANCES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR END USER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PCS THAT INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS AND EXCESS INVENTORY LEVELS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHILE OVERALL GROWTH IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS STABILIZING THE AREAS WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS ARE CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS BASED ON FORESEEING THOSE CHANGES AND MAKING TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM FACTORS THAT SERVE THOSE GROWING SUB SEGMENTS GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKNESS HAVE IN THE PAST IMPACTED THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED PURCHASES WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THESE DOWNTURNS THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT EMERGING GLOBAL MARKETS OUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SUCH MARKETS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE AND MAINTAIN LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKETS IF DEMAND FROM THESE MARKETS IS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US ACQUISITIONS DIVESTITURES AND OR JOINT VENTURES COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OR DILUTE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND GROW OUR BUSINESS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES SOLUTIONS OR TECHNOLOGIES OR THROUGH DIVESTITURES OR JOINT VENTURES RATHER THAN THROUGH INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE CANDIDATES CAN BE DIFFICULT TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IDENTIFIED ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES MOREOVER IF SUCH

ACQUISITION OR A JOINT VENTURE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE AND INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS ASSETS PERSONNEL OR OPERATIONS PARTICULARLY IF KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY DECIDE NOT TO WORK FOR US ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE ENTRY INTO GEOGRAPHIC OR BUSINESS MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONSEQUENTLY WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN ADDITION TO COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION WE MAY ISSUE EQUITY SECURITIES WHICH WOULD DILUTE OUR STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS INCUR DEBT ASSUME CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR HAVE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AND

SYSTEMS AND MODIFICATION OR INTERRUPTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS WE RELY UPON A NUMBER OF INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THESE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS NEED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SCALABLE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS OR UPGRADES THAT EXPOSE US TO A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL RISKS AS SUCH OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUALLY EVOLVE AND ADAPT IN ORDER TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS THESE CHANGES MAY BE COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL DEMANDS ON MANAGEMENT TIME THESE CHANGES MAY ALSO REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MODIFICATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES AND SIGNIFICANT TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTY RESOURCES WE CONTINUOUSLY WORK ON SIMPLIFYING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH CONSOLIDATION AND STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DISRUPTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSITION OUR

REPUTATIONAL HARM AND DISRUPTION OR DAMAGE TO OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION AS OUR IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WE ARE EMBRACING NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING AND SHARING DATA INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS USING METHODS SUCH AS MOBILITY AND THE CLOUD THAT CAN PROMOTE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY HOWEVER THESE PRACTICES CAN ALSO RESULT IN A MORE DISTRIBUTED IT ENVIRONMENT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAINTAIN VISIBILITY AND CONTROL OVER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS AND MEET SCALABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS IF OUR SECURITY CONTROLS CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CORRECTING ANY SUCH COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS IN A TIMELY MANNER IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE COMPATIBILITY WITH SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION THE MERE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEM RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS COSTS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US PRODUCTS AS COMPLEX AS THOSE WE OFFER MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS OR FAILURES WHEN FIRST INTRODUCED OR WHEN NEW VERSIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT DESPITE OUR TESTING PROCEDURES ERRORS WILL NOT BE FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS OR RELEASES AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF OR DELAY IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS MATERIAL RECALL AND REPLACEMENT COSTS LOSS OF REVENUE WRITING DOWN THE INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THE DIVERSION OF THE ATTENTION OF OUR ENGINEERING PERSONNEL FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR RELATED LIABILITIES INCLUDING PROPERTY DAMAGE PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND LOSS OF DATA OR INTANGIBLE PROPERTY AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN ADDITION WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING THE END CUSTOMERS OF THE DEFECTIVE

OUR PRODUCTS AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AGAINST US EVEN IF AN ALLEGED INJURY IS DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM RECALL OR OTHER CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO UNINSURED LIABILITIES OR FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AS WE RESPOND TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE PRODUCTS OUR CUSTOMERS WANT ON A TIMELY BASIS ACCORDINGLY WE RELY ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS EXPAND TO HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT MARKETS ACQUIRE NEW CUSTOMERS AND STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TEND TO HAVE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICULAR PRODUCTS AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES IN WHICH THEY REQUIRE DELIVERY OF THESE PRODUCTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER THE RIGHT PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS OUR CUSTOMERS MAY REDUCE THE QUANTITIES THEY ORDER FROM US WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD PARTIES CERTAIN SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS FUNCTIONS INCLUDING PORTIONS OF OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SERVICES WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS TO OPERATE OUR REGIONAL

MANNER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS IN WHICH CASE OUR INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED ALSO WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR CONTRACTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS WILL BE RENEWED IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD HAVE TO TRANSITION THESE FUNCTIONS IN HOUSE OR SECURE NEW PROVIDERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IF THE TRANSITION IS NOT EXECUTED APPROPRIATELY OUR STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY OUR STOCK PRICE HAS EXPERIENCED PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FUTURE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE WIDELY DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES BY US OR FINANCIAL ESTIMATES AND RATINGS BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY TO THE PUBLIC

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY CREATE UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN ARMED CONFLICTS THAT COULD HAVE A FURTHER IMPACT ON OUR SALES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THE CONSEQUENCES OF ARMED CONFLICT POLITICAL INSTABILITY OR CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FORESEE EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER HOSTILE ACTS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

UNITED STATES ECONOMY AND WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US WE HAVE COSTS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A CONSEQUENCE MOVEMENTS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD CAUSE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXPENSES TO INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE AFFECTING OUR PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS WHENEVER WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR SHORT TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WE DETERMINE OUR TOTAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE USING PROJECTIONS OF LONG TERM EXPENDITURES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW IN ADDITION THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN U S DOLLARS FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE U S DOLLAR AND THE LOCAL CURRENCY CAN CAUSE INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF SUCH CUSTOMERS AN APPRECIATION OF THE U S DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL CURRENCY COULD REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ON THE GRAY MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO OEMS AND THROUGH AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS FROM TIME TO TIME OUR PRODUCTS ARE DIVERTED FROM OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ARE SOLD ON THE GRAY MARKET GRAY MARKET PRODUCTS RESULT IN SHADOW INVENTORY THAT IS NOT VISIBLE TO US THUS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY ALSO WHEN GRAY MARKET PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET WE AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COMPETE WITH THESE HEAVILY DISCOUNTED GRAY MARKET PRODUCTS WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MARGINS IN ADDITION OUR INABILITY TO CONTROL GRAY MARKET ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES BECAUSE ANY TIME PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED OUTSIDE OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THERE IS A RISK THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE BUYING COUNTERFEIT OR SUBSTANDARD PRODUCTS INCLUDING PRODUCTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ALTERED MISHANDLED OR DAMAGED OR ARE USED PRODUCTS REPRESENTED AS NEW IF WE CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD THROUGH PATENTS COPYRIGHTS TRADE SECRETS TRADEMARKS AND OTHER MEASURES WE MAY LOSE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY CONTRACTS INCLUDING CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS COPYRIGHTS PATENTS TRADEMARKS AND COMMON LAW RIGHTS SUCH AS TRADE SECRETS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY HOWEVER WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT OR FROM MISAPPROPRIATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD ANY PATENT LICENSED BY US OR ISSUED TO US COULD BE CHALLENGED INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED OR RIGHTS GRANTED THERE UNDER MAY NOT PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO US FURTHERMORE PATENT APPLICATIONS THAT WE FILE MAY NOT RESULT IN ISSUANCE OF A PATENT OR IF A PATENT IS ISSUED THE PATENT MAY NOT BE ISSUED IN A FORM THAT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO US DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OTHERS MAY INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SIMILAR PRODUCTS DUPLICATE OUR PRODUCTS OR DESIGN AROUND OUR PATENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS IN ADDITION IT IS DIFFICULT TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE FOREIGN LAWS PROVIDE LESS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION THAN AFFORDED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE COMPROMISED AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WE ARE PARTY TO LITIGATION AND MAY BECOME A PARTY TO OTHER CLAIMS OR LITIGATION THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR PROHIBIT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE A DEFENDANT OR PLAINTIFF IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS CONCERNING FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OUR PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED BY AND OR USED BY CONSUMERS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION CLAIMS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON OCCASION WE RECEIVE CLAIMS THAT INDIVIDUALS WERE ALLEGEDLY EXPOSED TO SUBSTANCES USED IN OUR FORMER SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND THAT THIS ALLEGED EXPOSURE CAUSED HARM LITIGATION CAN INVOLVE COMPLEX FACTUAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS AND ITS OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF A CLAIM IS SUCCESSFULLY ASSERTED AGAINST US INCLUDING THE CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT COULD RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF OR THIRD PARTIES MAY BRING OR HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST US AND OR AGAINST OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CONTRIBUTING TO OR INDUCING THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS IMPROPERLY CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE IMPROPERLY USING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS IF ANY SUCH CLAIMS ARE ASSERTED WE MAY SEEK TO OBTAIN A LICENSE UNDER THE THIRD PARTIES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL OF THE NECESSARY LICENSES ON SATISFACTORY TERMS IF AT ALL THESE PARTIES MAY FILE LAWSUITS AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS SEEKING DAMAGES POTENTIALLY UP TO AND INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES OR AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE SALE OF PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR AGAINST THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR HAVING TO STOP THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TO INCREASE THE COSTS OF SELLING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION THE AWARD OF DAMAGES INCLUDING MATERIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES OR THE ENTRY OF AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE COULD DECIDE IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS OR TO RESORT TO LITIGATION TO CHALLENGE SUCH CLAIMS SUCH CHALLENGES COULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT RELEASE OR SHIPMENT AND OR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LITIGATION RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED OR SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED EVEN IF WE WERE TO PREVAIL ANY LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND WOULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX CLAIMS BY TAX AGENCIES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TAX LAWS ARE DYNAMIC AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS NEW LAWS ARE PASSED AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ARE ISSUED OR APPLIED THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE REDUCTION FROM TO THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE THE TAX REFORM ACT ALSO TRANSITIONS INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDES BASE EROSION PREVENTION MEASURES ON NON U S EARNINGS WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SUBJECTING CERTAIN EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO UNITED STATES TAXATION IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF ANY TAX AUDITS AND LITIGATION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ASSESSMENT OR LITIGATION THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH TAX PROVISIONS AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CONFLICT MINERALS RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES OUR OPERATIONS AND PROPERTIES HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THE TREATMENT TRANSPORT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE OUR SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS FOR OPERATIONS MAKING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND WASTEWATER ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO OVERSEE OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLIANCE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IF OUR SUPPLIERS VIOLATE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THEM A RANGE OF CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT INCLUDING FINES SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION ALTERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IMPORT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SALES LIMITATIONS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES OR OTHER SANCTIONS SUCH NON COMPLIANCE FROM OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY HIGHER SOURCING COSTS AND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS AND SERVERS BASED ON ENERGY STAR SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION LIMITS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THESE MARKETS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF OR THE SUPERFUND ACT IMPOSE STRICT OR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ON CURRENT AND PREVIOUS OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF REAL PROPERTY FOR THE COST OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY EVEN IF THE OWNER OR OPERATOR DID NOT KNOW OF OR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO ASSESS LIABILITY ON PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TO BE SENT TO DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITIES WHEN SUCH FACILITIES ARE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED SUCH PERSONS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS EVEN IF THEY NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED THE CONTAMINATED FACILITY WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT THREE SUPERFUND SITES IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WE COULD BE NAMED A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT OTHER SUPERFUND OR CONTAMINATED SITES IN THE FUTURE IN ADDITION CONTAMINATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED COULD EXIST AT OUR OTHER FACILITIES UNDER THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF THE SEC ADOPTED DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES THAT USE CONFLICT MINERALS ORIGINATING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO OR ADJOINING COUNTRIES WE CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPING INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF ANY CONFLICT MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AUDITING THE PROCESS AND REPORTING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE SEC IN ADDITION TO THE SEC REGULATION THE EUROPEAN UNION CHINA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE DEVELOPING NEW POLICIES FOCUSED ON CONFLICT MINERALS THAT MAY IMPACT AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ALSO SINCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IS COMPLEX WE MAY FACE REPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY VERIFY THE ORIGINS OF THE SUBJECT MINERALS MOREOVER WE ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES TO SATISFY THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CERTIFIED AS CONFLICT FREE IF WE CANNOT SATISFY THESE CUSTOMERS THEY MAY CHOOSE A COMPETITOR S PRODUCTS THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED NEW POLICIES FOR FEDERAL PROCUREMENT FOCUSED ON ERADICATING THE PRACTICE OF FORCED LABOR AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN ADDITION THE UNITED KINGDOM AUSTRALIA AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ISSUED LAWS THAT REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE OUR POLICY AND PRACTICES FOR IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING FORCED LABOR AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SEVERAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS THE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ALLIANCE HAVE ALSO ISSUED EXPECTATIONS TO ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPACT US WHILE WE HAVE A

ARE COMPONENTS USED IN A VARIETY OF ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT IC IS A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE THAT CONSISTS OF MANY INTERCONNECTED TRANSISTORS ON A SINGLE CHIP SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE TRANSISTOR IN IMPROVEMENTS IN IC PROCESS AND DESIGN TECHNOLOGIES HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALLER MORE COMPLEX AND MORE RELIABLE ICS AT A LOWER COST PER FUNCTION THE X MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET MARKETS CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT CPU A MICROPROCESSOR IS AN IC THAT SERVES AS THE CPU OF A COMPUTER IT GENERALLY CONSISTS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF TRANSISTORS THAT PROCESS DATA IN A SERIAL FASHION AND CONTROL OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM ACTING AS THE BRAIN OF THE COMPUTER THE PERFORMANCE OF A MICROPROCESSOR IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IMPACTING THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTING AND ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORMS SUCH AS DESKTOP PCS NOTEBOOKS AND WORKSTATIONS THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS USED TO MEASURE CPU PERFORMANCE ARE WORK PER CYCLE OR HOW MANY INSTRUCTIONS ARE EXECUTED PER CYCLE CLOCK SPEED REPRESENTING THE RATE AT WHICH A CPU S INTERNAL LOGIC OPERATES MEASURED IN UNITS OF GIGAHERTZ OR BILLIONS OF CYCLES PER SECOND AND POWER CONSUMPTION OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING MICROPROCESSOR PERFORMANCE INCLUDE THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY USED IN ITS MANUFACTURE THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF CORES THE ABILITY OF THE CORES TO PROCESS MULTI THREAD OR PROCESS MULTIPLE INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY THE BIT SIZE OF ITS INSTRUCTION SET E G BIT VS BIT MEMORY SIZE AND DATA ACCESS SPEED DEVELOPMENTS IN IC DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN MICROPROCESSOR PERFORMANCE SINCE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS REQUIRE GREATER PERFORMANCE FROM THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS DUE TO THE GROWTH OF DIGITAL DATA AND INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS MULTI CORE MICROPROCESSORS OFFER ENHANCED OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY BECAUSE COMPUTING TASKS CAN BE SPREAD ACROSS TWO OR MORE PROCESSING CORES EACH OF WHICH CAN EXECUTE A TASK AT FULL SPEED MULTI CORE MICROPROCESSORS CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE PERFORMANCE OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM WITHOUT GREATLY INCREASING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF POWER CONSUMED AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HEAT EMITTED BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ALSO REQUIRE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITH IMPROVED POWER MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY WHICH HELPS THEM TO REDUCE THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS ENABLES SMALLER AND

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS

SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS

TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED AT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES OPERATED BY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHINA MALAYSIA AND TAIWAN WE ALSO HAVE INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS INTERNATIONAL SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE WERE IN WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION EXPROPRIATION CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY S OR REGION S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS TRADE

PROTECTION REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE COLLECT PROCESS AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON COMPLIANCE ALSO THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OUR ISSUANCE TO WEST COAST HITECH L P WCH

GROSS MARGIN INCLUDE A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS A PRODUCTION OR DESIGN DEFECT IN OUR PRODUCTS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOR OUR OLDER PRODUCTS AS OUR NEW PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED OR OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR TAKING AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH THEY ARE SOLD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR

OTHERS CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED OR SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED EVEN IF WE WERE TO PREVAIL ANY LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND WOULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX CLAIMS BY TAX AGENCIES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TAX LAWS ARE DYNAMIC AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS NEW LAWS ARE PASSED AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ARE ISSUED OR APPLIED THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE REDUCTION FROM TO THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE THE TAX REFORM ACT ALSO TRANSITIONS INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDES BASE EROSION PREVENTION MEASURES ON NON U S EARNINGS WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SUBJECTING CERTAIN EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO UNITED STATES TAXATION THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE IN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF ANY TAX AUDITS AND LITIGATION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ASSESSMENT OR LITIGATION THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH TAX PROVISIONS AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CONFLICT MINERALS RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET

ENVIRONMENT THE TREATMENT TRANSPORT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE OUR SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS FOR OPERATIONS MAKING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND WASTEWATER ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO OVERSEE OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLIANCE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IF OUR SUPPLIERS VIOLATE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THEM A RANGE OF CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT INCLUDING FINES SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION ALTERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IMPORT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SALES LIMITATIONS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES OR OTHER SANCTIONS SUCH NON COMPLIANCE FROM OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY HIGHER SOURCING COSTS AND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS AND SERVERS BASED ON ENERGY STAR SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION LIMITS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THESE MARKETS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE

REAL PROPERTY FOR THE COST OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY EVEN IF THE OWNER OR OPERATOR DID NOT KNOW OF OR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO ASSESS LIABILITY ON PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TO BE SENT TO DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITIES WHEN SUCH FACILITIES ARE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED SUCH PERSONS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS EVEN IF THEY NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED THE CONTAMINATED FACILITY WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT THREE SUPERFUND SITES IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WE COULD BE NAMED A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT OTHER SUPERFUND OR CONTAMINATED SITES

DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES THAT USE CONFLICT MINERALS ORIGINATING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO OR ADJOINING COUNTRIES WE CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED

MINERALS MOREOVER WE ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES TO SATISFY THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CERTIFIED AS CONFLICT FREE IF WE CANNOT SATISFY THESE CUSTOMERS THEY MAY CHOOSE A COMPETITOR S PRODUCTS THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED NEW POLICIES FOR FEDERAL PROCUREMENT FOCUSED ON ERADICATING THE PRACTICE OF FORCED LABOR AND HUMAN

COMPARED TO BILLION AS OF DECEMBER WE INTEND THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOWS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTED IN THOSE CHANGES AND HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U S GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES U S GAAP THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ON GOING BASIS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR REVENUE INVENTORIES GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALTHOUGH ACTUAL RESULTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN REASONABLY CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT S EXPECTATIONS THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES OR OUR ESTIMATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS REVENUE RECOGNITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD EFFECTIVE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON THE SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS SELL IN RATHER THAN UPON THE RESALE OF THE PRODUCT BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS SELL THROUGH ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROVISIONS FOR RIGHTS OF RETURN AND PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD PRODUCT HELD BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS REVENUE ALLOWANCES WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ON PRODUCT SALES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE PRICE REDUCTIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVES IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECORDED WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON ACTUAL HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS HISTORICAL ALLOWANCES HISTORICAL PRICE REDUCTIONS MARKET ACTIVITY AND OTHER KNOWN OR ANTICIPATED TRENDS AND FACTORS THESE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT S JUDGMENT AND ACTUAL PROVISIONS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES AND CURRENT PROVISIONS RESULTING IN FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS INVENTORY VALUATION AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE WE EVALUATE OUR ENDING INVENTORIES FOR EXCESS QUANTITIES AND OBSOLESCENCE BASED ON PROJECTED SALES OUTLOOK THIS EVALUATION INCLUDES ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL SALES LEVELS BY PRODUCT AND PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND THESE PROJECTIONS ASSIST US IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IN ADDITION WE WRITE OFF INVENTORIES THAT WE CONSIDER OBSOLETE WE ADJUST THE REMAINING SPECIFIC INVENTORY BALANCES TO APPROXIMATE THE LOWER OF OUR STANDARD MANUFACTURING COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AMONG OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS FORECASTED DEMAND IN RELATION TO THE INVENTORY ON HAND COMPETITIVENESS OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES WHEN DETERMINING OBSOLESCENCE AND REALIZABLE VALUE IF IN ANY PERIOD WE ANTICIPATE FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS TO BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATES ADDITIONAL INVENTORY WRITE DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED AND WOULD BE REFLECTED IN COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE THIS WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN IN THAT PERIOD IF IN ANY PERIOD WE ARE ABLE TO SELL INVENTORIES THAT WERE NOT VALUED OR THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN DOWN IN A PREVIOUS PERIOD RELATED REVENUES WOULD BE RECORDED WITHOUT ANY OFFSETTING CHARGE TO COST OF SALES RESULTING IN A NET BENEFIT TO OUR GROSS MARGIN IN THAT PERIOD GOODWILL WE PERFORM OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR AND IF CERTAIN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS THE ANALYSIS MAY INCLUDE BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN IMPAIRMENT QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATION OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHARE PRICE TRENDS AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND COMPANY SPECIFIC EVENTS WE FIRST ANALYZE QUALITATIVE FACTORS IF WE CONCLUDE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING AMOUNT WE DO NOT PROCEED TO PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS IF NECESSARY CONSIDERS THE INCOME APPROACH WHICH REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE A REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNT RATES AND FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IF WE CONCLUDE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT INCOME TAXES IN DETERMINING TAXABLE INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE APPLIED IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES AND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHICH ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY WE MUST INCREASE OUR CHARGE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE FORM OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE WE CONSIDER PAST PERFORMANCE FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN ADDITION THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX RULES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE ADJUSTMENT OF OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OR OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES IF OUR ESTIMATES OF THESE TAXES ARE GREATER OR LESS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS AN ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFIT OR CHARGE WILL RESULT WE RECOGNIZE THE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX

SALES VOLUMES CAPABLE OF OFFSETTING THE REDUCTIONS IN THE SALE PRICES OF EXISTING PRODUCTS OVER TIME OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE CANNOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN EXTERNAL FINANCING WE MAY FACE A CASH SHORTFALL AND BE UNABLE TO MAKE ALL OF OUR PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS OUR ABILITY TO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DEPENDS ON GENERATING SUFFICIENT REVENUE AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTERNAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOGETHER WITH ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL DRAIN ON OUR CASH FLOW AND MAY DECREASE OUR CASH BALANCES IF NEW COMPETITORS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BY EXISTING COMPETITORS OR OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN ANTICIPATED IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD INCREASE IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN ANTICIPATED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN REVENUE OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD DECLINE WE REGULARLY ASSESS MARKETS

OF OUR SALES MAY BE WEIGHTED DIFFERENTLY DURING THE YEAR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR QUARTERLY SALES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MADE IN THE LAST MONTH OF THE QUARTER THIS UNEVEN SALES PATTERN MAKES PREDICTION OF REVENUE FOR EACH FINANCIAL PERIOD DIFFICULT AND INCREASES THE RISK OF UNANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ADDITION OUR OPERATING RESULTS TEND TO VARY SEASONALLY WITH THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FOR EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY FIRST QUARTER PC PRODUCT SALES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND WITH RESPECT TO OUR SEMI CUSTOM SOC PRODUCTS

FOR WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE AND OTHER PURPOSES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES REQUIRE US TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO MAKE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH RELATIVELY LESS DEBT AND INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS WE ENTER INTO SALE AND FACTORING

AGREEMENT OF AT LEAST MILLION ANY OF OUR FUTURE DEBT AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS IF WE FAIL TO MAKE ANY CASH PAYMENT ON A SERIES OF NOTES WHEN REQUIRED BY THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE IT

CERTAIN BORROWED MONEY PRIOR TO ITS DUE DATE AND ENTER INTO ANY NON ARM S LENGTH TRANSACTION WITH AN AFFILIATE EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS WHEREBY A DEFAULT UNDER ONE AGREEMENT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN CROSS DEFAULTS UNDER AGREEMENTS COVERING OTHER BORROWINGS FOR EXAMPLE THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR ANY FAILURE TO REPAY DEBT WHEN DUE IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF MILLION WOULD CAUSE A CROSS DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURES TO THE EXTENT SUCH DEFAULT WOULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS GOVERNING OUR NOTES NOTES AND NOTES AS WELL AS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT UNDER ANY OF THESE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WOULD PERMIT THE APPLICABLE NOTE HOLDERS OR THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO DECLARE ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THOSE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE IF THE NOTE HOLDERS OR THE TRUSTEE UNDER THE INDENTURES GOVERNING OUR NOTES NOTES OR NOTES OR THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT ACCELERATE THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY THOSE BORROWINGS THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND DELIVERING THE LATEST AND BEST PRODUCTS TO MARKET ON A TIMELY BASIS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING REVENUE GROWTH WE BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE OUR PRODUCT COMPETITIVENESS ARE TIMELY PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRODUCT QUALITY PRODUCT FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES INCLUDING ENABLING STATE OF THE ART VISUAL AND VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCLUDING POWER CONSUMPTION AND BATTERY LIFE RELIABILITY PROCESSOR CLOCK SPEED PERFORMANCE SIZE OR FORM FACTOR SELLING PRICE COST ADHERENCE TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CREATION OF OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY SECURITY AND STABILITY BRAND RECOGNITION AND AVAILABILITY WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTENSE DUE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS OR NEW COMPETITORS OF PRODUCTS THAT MAY PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE OR MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS UNCOMPETITIVE WE MAY ALSO FACE AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY COMPETITORS ESPECIALLY DURING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IN ADDITION OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AND SALES RESOURCES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN SUCH A DECLINING MARKET LEADING TO LOWER PRICES AND MARGINS SOME COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER ACCESS OR RIGHTS TO COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING INTERFACE PROCESSOR AND MEMORY TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE WITH OUR APU PRODUCTS AND OTHER COMPETING SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY HAVE STRONGER POSITIONS IN THESE NEW MARKETS OR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING INDUSTRY TRENDS WE MAY FACE DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAN ANTICIPATED OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

OPERATED BY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHINA MALAYSIA AND TAIWAN WE ALSO HAVE INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS INTERNATIONAL SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE WERE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION EXPROPRIATION CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY S OR REGION S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS DIFFICULTIES IN PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING STAFFING AND EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR LAWS CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CONTROL AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT IN ADDITION OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD BE SUBJECT TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES TSUNAMIS FLOODING TYPHOONS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT DISRUPT MANUFACTURING OR OTHER OPERATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OUR SANTA CLARA OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES IN CALIFORNIA THERE MAY BE CONFLICT OR UNCERTAINTY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AN OUTBREAK OF A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE SUCH AS AVIAN INFLUENZA MEASLES OR EBOLA SAFETY ISSUES NATURAL DISASTERS FIRE DISRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS OR GENERAL ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED KINGDOM S REFERENDUM COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BREXIT HAS CREATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ALSO THE EUROPEAN UNION S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE COLLECT PROCESS AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON COMPLIANCE ALSO THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS THE CONVERSION OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR MAY OTHERWISE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE CONVERSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS THE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE SALE PRICE FOR CONVERSION WAS SATISFIED AS OF THE END OF MARCH AND AS A RESULT THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION DURING THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER OF ANY SALES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON SUCH CONVERSION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN ADDITION THE EXISTENCE OF THE NOTES MAY ENCOURAGE SHORT SELLING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE THE CONVERSION THEREOF COULD BE USED TO SATISFY SHORT POSITIONS OR THE ANTICIPATED

BASE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS IN PART ON CUSTOMERS ESTIMATES OF DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WHICH MAY NOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE QUANTITY OR TYPE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL WANT IN THE FUTURE OR ULTIMATELY END UP PURCHASING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST DEMAND IS EVEN FURTHER COMPLICATED WHEN OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD INDIRECTLY THROUGH DOWNSTREAM CHANNEL DISTRIBUTORS AND CUSTOMERS AS OUR FORECASTS

CANCELLATION OR DEFERRAL OF PRODUCT ORDERS OR OVERPRODUCTION DUE TO FAILURE OF ANTICIPATED ORDERS TO MATERIALIZE COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF INVENTORY AND AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GROSS MARGINS FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE DOWNS OF THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY A REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OR A REDUCTION IN OUR GROSS MARGIN INCLUDE A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS A PRODUCTION OR DESIGN DEFECT IN OUR PRODUCTS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOR OUR OLDER PRODUCTS AS OUR NEW PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED OR OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR TAKING AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH THEY ARE SOLD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A MARKET DECLINE IN ANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON THE CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHICH HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED A DECLINE DRIVEN BY AMONG OTHER FACTORS THE ADOPTION OF SMALLER AND OTHER FORM FACTORS INCREASED COMPETITION AND CHANGES IN

PLAYSTATION SONY PLAYSTATION PRO MICROSOFT XBOX ONE S AND MICROSOFT XBOX ONE X GAME CONSOLE SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE IN ADDITION THE GPU MARKET HAS AT TIMES SEEN ELEVATED DEMAND DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF GPU PRODUCTS TO CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING FOR EXAMPLE OUR GPU REVENUE HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN PART BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET DEMAND FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS CHANGED AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE QUICKLY FOR EXAMPLE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE INSTITUTED RESTRICTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING AND THE VALUATIONS OF THE CURRENCIES AND CORRESPONDING INTEREST IN MINING OF SUCH CURRENCIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE RISKS RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET OUR GPU BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERE DOWNTURNS THAT HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONSTANT AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONTINUOUS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRICE EROSION AND DECLINES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN RECENT DOWNTURNS DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMBALANCES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR END USER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PCS THAT INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS AND EXCESS INVENTORY LEVELS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHILE OVERALL GROWTH IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS STABILIZING THE AREAS WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS ARE CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS BASED ON FORESEEING THOSE CHANGES AND MAKING TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM FACTORS THAT SERVE THOSE GROWING SUB SEGMENTS GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKNESS HAVE IN THE PAST IMPACTED THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED PURCHASES WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THESE DOWNTURNS THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT EMERGING GLOBAL MARKETS OUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SUCH MARKETS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE AND MAINTAIN LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKETS IF DEMAND FROM THESE MARKETS IS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US ACQUISITIONS DIVESTITURES AND OR JOINT VENTURES COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OR DILUTE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND GROW OUR BUSINESS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES SOLUTIONS OR TECHNOLOGIES OR THROUGH DIVESTITURES OR JOINT VENTURES RATHER THAN THROUGH INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE CANDIDATES CAN BE DIFFICULT TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IDENTIFIED ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES MOREOVER IF SUCH ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION OR A JOINT VENTURE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE AND INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS ASSETS PERSONNEL OR OPERATIONS PARTICULARLY IF KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY DECIDE NOT TO WORK FOR US ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE ENTRY INTO GEOGRAPHIC OR BUSINESS MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONSEQUENTLY WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN ADDITION TO COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION WE MAY ISSUE EQUITY SECURITIES WHICH WOULD DILUTE OUR STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS INCUR DEBT ASSUME CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR HAVE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AND WRITE DOWNS OF ACQUIRED ASSETS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY ALSO REDUCE OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS AND OTHER USES WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS ALSO ANY FAILURE ON OUR PART TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND EXECUTE NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS WE MAY NOT ADEQUATELY ASSESS THE RISK OF NEW BUSINESS

CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO FLUCTUATING OR LATE SUPPLY FROM THE JVS IT COULD RESULT IN LOST SALES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM ANY NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES WE HAVE A JOINT VENTURE WITH HIGON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CO LTD THATIC COMPRISED OF TWO SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITIES CHINA JV AND CHINA JV COLLECTIVELY THE THATIC JV WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THIS JOINT VENTURE INCLUDING THE THATIC JV S EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE THE RECEIPT OF ANY FUTURE MILESTONE PAYMENTS FROM CERTAIN LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE RECEIPT OF ANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FUTURE SALES OF PRODUCTS BY THE THATIC JV OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MODIFICATION OR INTERRUPTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS WE RELY UPON A NUMBER OF INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THESE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS NEED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SCALABLE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS OR UPGRADES THAT EXPOSE US TO A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL RISKS AS SUCH OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUALLY EVOLVE AND ADAPT IN ORDER TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS THESE CHANGES MAY BE COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL DEMANDS ON MANAGEMENT TIME THESE CHANGES MAY ALSO REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MODIFICATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES AND SIGNIFICANT TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTY RESOURCES WE CONTINUOUSLY WORK ON SIMPLIFYING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH CONSOLIDATION AND STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DISRUPTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSITION OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS OR BUSINESS PARTNERS MAY ALSO BE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION CAUSED BY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL

REPUTATIONAL HARM AND DISRUPTION OR DAMAGE TO OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION AS OUR IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WE ARE EMBRACING NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING AND SHARING DATA INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS USING METHODS SUCH AS MOBILITY AND THE CLOUD THAT CAN PROMOTE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY HOWEVER THESE PRACTICES CAN ALSO RESULT IN A MORE DISTRIBUTED IT ENVIRONMENT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAINTAIN VISIBILITY AND CONTROL OVER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS AND MEET SCALABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS IF OUR SECURITY CONTROLS CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WE MAY PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS FOR USE BY OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND UPON OBTAINING DELIVERIES OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS ON A TIMELY BASIS OUR THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS ALSO DEPEND ON THE SAME TIMELY DELIVERY OF ADEQUATE QUANTITIES OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN ADDITION AS MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS INCREASE IN TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY WE RELY ON OUR THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO UPDATE THEIR PROCESSES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MEETING OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING NEEDS CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OR IN SOME CASES A SOLE SUPPLIER WE ALSO DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGES FOR OUR MICROPROCESSORS INCLUDING OUR APU PRODUCTS SIMILARLY CERTAIN NON PROPRIETARY MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS SUCH AS MEMORY PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS PCBS INTERPOSERS SUBSTRATES AND CAPACITORS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE

COMPONENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN PRICE AND AVAILABILITY INTERRUPTION OF SUPPLY OR INCREASED DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY COULD CAUSE SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES IN VARIOUS ESSENTIAL MATERIALS DEPENDENCE ON A SOLE SUPPLIER OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS EXACERBATES THESE RISKS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCURE CERTAIN OF THESE MATERIALS FOR OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR OUR THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES OR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS ARE UNABLE TO PROCURE MATERIALS FOR MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRODUCTS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME OR ALL INDUSTRY STANDARD SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH SOME OR ALL INDUSTRY STANDARD SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE FURTHER WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CORRECTING ANY SUCH COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS IN A TIMELY MANNER IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE COMPATIBILITY WITH SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION THE MERE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEM RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS COSTS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US PRODUCTS AS COMPLEX AS THOSE WE OFFER MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS OR FAILURES WHEN FIRST INTRODUCED OR WHEN NEW VERSIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT DESPITE OUR TESTING PROCEDURES ERRORS WILL NOT BE FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS OR RELEASES AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF OR DELAY IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS MATERIAL RECALL AND REPLACEMENT COSTS LOSS OF REVENUE WRITING DOWN THE INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THE DIVERSION OF THE ATTENTION OF OUR ENGINEERING PERSONNEL FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR RELATED LIABILITIES INCLUDING PROPERTY DAMAGE PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND LOSS OF DATA OR INTANGIBLE PROPERTY AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN ADDITION WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING THE END CUSTOMERS OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD AS A RESULT WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT MODIFICATIONS TO CORRECT DEFECTS ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS CAUSES OR MERELY APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED AN INJURY WHETHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE CLAIMS MAY BE MADE BY CONSUMERS OR OTHERS SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AGAINST US EVEN IF AN ALLEGED INJURY IS DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM RECALL OR OTHER CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO UNINSURED LIABILITIES

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE PRODUCTS OUR CUSTOMERS WANT ON A TIMELY BASIS ACCORDINGLY WE RELY ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS EXPAND TO HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT MARKETS ACQUIRE NEW CUSTOMERS AND STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TEND TO HAVE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICULAR PRODUCTS AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES IN WHICH THEY REQUIRE DELIVERY OF THESE PRODUCTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER THE RIGHT PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS OUR CUSTOMERS MAY REDUCE THE QUANTITIES THEY ORDER FROM US WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD PARTIES CERTAIN SUPPLY

THAT OUR CONTRACTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS WILL BE RENEWED IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD HAVE TO TRANSITION THESE FUNCTIONS IN HOUSE OR SECURE NEW PROVIDERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IF THE TRANSITION IS NOT EXECUTED APPROPRIATELY OUR STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY OUR STOCK PRICE HAS EXPERIENCED PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO

CURRENCIES AS A CONSEQUENCE MOVEMENTS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD CAUSE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXPENSES TO INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE AFFECTING OUR PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS WHENEVER WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR SHORT TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WE DETERMINE OUR TOTAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE USING PROJECTIONS OF LONG TERM EXPENDITURES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW IN ADDITION THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN U S DOLLARS FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE U S DOLLAR AND THE LOCAL CURRENCY CAN CAUSE INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF SUCH CUSTOMERS AN APPRECIATION OF THE U S DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL CURRENCY COULD REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ON THE GRAY MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO OEMS AND THROUGH AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS FROM TIME TO TIME OUR PRODUCTS ARE DIVERTED FROM OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ARE SOLD ON THE GRAY MARKET GRAY

CHANNELS COMPETE WITH THESE HEAVILY DISCOUNTED GRAY MARKET PRODUCTS WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MARGINS IN ADDITION OUR INABILITY TO CONTROL GRAY MARKET

PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OTHERS MAY INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SIMILAR PRODUCTS DUPLICATE OUR PRODUCTS OR DESIGN AROUND OUR PATENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS IN ADDITION IT IS DIFFICULT TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE FOREIGN LAWS PROVIDE LESS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION THAN AFFORDED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE COMPROMISED AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WE ARE PARTY TO LITIGATION AND MAY BECOME A PARTY TO OTHER CLAIMS OR LITIGATION THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR PROHIBIT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE A DEFENDANT OR PLAINTIFF IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS CONCERNING FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OUR PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED BY AND OR USED BY CONSUMERS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION CLAIMS INCLUDING

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND THAT THIS ALLEGED EXPOSURE CAUSED HARM LITIGATION CAN INVOLVE COMPLEX FACTUAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS AND ITS OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF A CLAIM IS SUCCESSFULLY ASSERTED AGAINST US INCLUDING THE CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT COULD RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF OR THIRD PARTIES MAY BRING OR HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST US AND OR AGAINST OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CONTRIBUTING TO OR INDUCING THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS IMPROPERLY CLAIMING OWNERSHIP

DAMAGES INCLUDING MATERIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES OR THE ENTRY OF AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE COULD DECIDE IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS OR TO RESORT TO LITIGATION TO CHALLENGE SUCH CLAIMS SUCH CHALLENGES COULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT RELEASE OR SHIPMENT AND OR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LITIGATION RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED OR SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED EVEN IF WE WERE TO PREVAIL ANY LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND WOULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX CLAIMS BY TAX AGENCIES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TAX LAWS ARE DYNAMIC AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS NEW LAWS ARE PASSED AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ARE ISSUED OR APPLIED THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE REDUCTION FROM TO THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE THE TAX REFORM ACT ALSO TRANSITIONS INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDES BASE EROSION PREVENTION MEASURES ON NON U S EARNINGS WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SUBJECTING CERTAIN EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO UNITED STATES TAXATION IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF ANY TAX AUDITS AND LITIGATION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ASSESSMENT OR LITIGATION THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH TAX PROVISIONS AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CONFLICT MINERALS RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES OUR OPERATIONS AND PROPERTIES HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THE TREATMENT TRANSPORT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE OUR SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS FOR OPERATIONS MAKING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND WASTEWATER ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO OVERSEE OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLIANCE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IF OUR SUPPLIERS VIOLATE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THEM A RANGE OF CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT INCLUDING FINES SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION ALTERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IMPORT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SALES LIMITATIONS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES OR OTHER SANCTIONS SUCH NON COMPLIANCE FROM OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY HIGHER SOURCING COSTS AND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS AND SERVERS BASED ON ENERGY STAR SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION LIMITS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THESE MARKETS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE

REAL PROPERTY FOR THE COST OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY EVEN IF THE OWNER OR OPERATOR DID NOT KNOW OF OR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO ASSESS LIABILITY ON PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TO BE SENT TO DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITIES WHEN SUCH FACILITIES ARE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED SUCH PERSONS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS EVEN IF THEY NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED THE CONTAMINATED FACILITY WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT THREE SUPERFUND SITES IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WE COULD BE NAMED A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT OTHER SUPERFUND OR CONTAMINATED SITES IN THE FUTURE IN ADDITION CONTAMINATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED COULD EXIST AT OUR OTHER FACILITIES UNDER THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF THE SEC ADOPTED

CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS WHEREBY A DEFAULT UNDER ONE AGREEMENT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN CROSS DEFAULTS UNDER AGREEMENTS COVERING OTHER BORROWINGS FOR EXAMPLE THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR ANY FAILURE TO REPAY DEBT WHEN DUE IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF MILLION

SELLING PRICE COST ADHERENCE TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CREATION OF OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY SECURITY AND STABILITY BRAND RECOGNITION AND

BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE OR MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS UNCOMPETITIVE WE MAY ALSO FACE AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY COMPETITORS ESPECIALLY DURING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IN ADDITION OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AND SALES RESOURCES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN SUCH A DECLINING MARKET LEADING TO LOWER PRICES AND MARGINS SOME COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER ACCESS OR RIGHTS TO COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING INTERFACE PROCESSOR AND MEMORY TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE WITH OUR APU PRODUCTS AND OTHER COMPETING SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS

HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OUR ISSUANCE TO WEST COAST HITECH L P WCH

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN RECENT DOWNTURNS DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMBALANCES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR END USER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PCS THAT INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS AND EXCESS INVENTORY LEVELS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHILE OVERALL GROWTH IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS STABILIZING THE AREAS WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS ARE CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS BASED ON FORESEEING THOSE CHANGES AND MAKING TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM FACTORS THAT SERVE THOSE GROWING SUB SEGMENTS GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKNESS HAVE IN THE PAST IMPACTED THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED PURCHASES WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THESE DOWNTURNS THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT EMERGING GLOBAL MARKETS OUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SUCH MARKETS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE AND MAINTAIN LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKETS IF DEMAND FROM THESE MARKETS IS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US ACQUISITIONS DIVESTITURES AND OR JOINT VENTURES COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OR DILUTE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND GROW OUR BUSINESS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES SOLUTIONS OR TECHNOLOGIES OR THROUGH DIVESTITURES OR JOINT VENTURES RATHER THAN THROUGH INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE CANDIDATES CAN BE DIFFICULT TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IDENTIFIED ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES MOREOVER IF SUCH ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION OR A JOINT VENTURE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE AND INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS ASSETS PERSONNEL OR OPERATIONS PARTICULARLY IF KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY DECIDE NOT TO WORK FOR US ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE ENTRY INTO GEOGRAPHIC OR BUSINESS MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONSEQUENTLY WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN ADDITION TO COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION WE MAY ISSUE EQUITY SECURITIES WHICH WOULD DILUTE OUR STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS INCUR DEBT ASSUME CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR HAVE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AND WRITE DOWNS OF ACQUIRED ASSETS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY ALSO REDUCE OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS AND OTHER USES WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS ALSO ANY FAILURE ON OUR PART TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND EXECUTE NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS WE MAY NOT ADEQUATELY ASSESS THE RISK OF NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS MAY ARISE THAT ALTER THE RISKS THAT WERE INITIALLY CONSIDERED FURTHERMORE WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE OPERATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE MAJORITY OF OUR ATMP SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY THE JVS AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE JVS WILL BE ABLE TO FULFILL OUR LONG TERM ATMP REQUIREMENTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO FLUCTUATING OR LATE SUPPLY FROM THE JVS IT COULD RESULT IN LOST SALES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM ANY NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES WE HAVE A JOINT VENTURE WITH HIGON

NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THIS JOINT VENTURE INCLUDING THE THATIC JV S EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE THE RECEIPT OF ANY FUTURE MILESTONE PAYMENTS FROM CERTAIN LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE RECEIPT OF ANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FUTURE SALES OF PRODUCTS BY THE THATIC JV OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MODIFICATION OR INTERRUPTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS WE RELY UPON A NUMBER OF INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THESE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS NEED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SCALABLE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS OR UPGRADES THAT EXPOSE US TO A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL RISKS AS SUCH OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUALLY EVOLVE AND ADAPT IN ORDER TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS THESE CHANGES MAY BE COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL DEMANDS ON MANAGEMENT TIME THESE CHANGES MAY ALSO REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MODIFICATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES AND SIGNIFICANT TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTY RESOURCES WE CONTINUOUSLY WORK ON SIMPLIFYING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH CONSOLIDATION AND STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DISRUPTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSITION OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS OR BUSINESS PARTNERS MAY ALSO BE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION CAUSED BY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CATASTROPHIC EVENTS POWER ANOMALIES OR OUTAGES NATURAL DISASTERS VIRUSES OR MALWARE CYBER ATTACKS DATA BREACHES AND COMPUTER SYSTEM OR NETWORK FAILURES EXPOSING US TO SIGNIFICANT COST REPUTATIONAL HARM AND DISRUPTION OR DAMAGE TO OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION AS OUR IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WE ARE EMBRACING NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING AND SHARING DATA INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS USING METHODS SUCH AS MOBILITY AND THE CLOUD THAT CAN PROMOTE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY HOWEVER THESE PRACTICES CAN ALSO RESULT IN A MORE DISTRIBUTED IT ENVIRONMENT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAINTAIN VISIBILITY AND CONTROL OVER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS AND MEET SCALABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS IF OUR SECURITY CONTROLS CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WE MAY PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS FOR USE BY OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND UPON OBTAINING DELIVERIES OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS ON A TIMELY BASIS OUR THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS ALSO DEPEND ON THE SAME TIMELY DELIVERY OF ADEQUATE QUANTITIES OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN ADDITION AS MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS INCREASE IN TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY WE RELY ON OUR THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO UPDATE THEIR PROCESSES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MEETING OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING NEEDS CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OR IN SOME CASES A SOLE SUPPLIER WE ALSO DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGES FOR OUR MICROPROCESSORS INCLUDING OUR APU PRODUCTS SIMILARLY CERTAIN NON PROPRIETARY MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS SUCH AS MEMORY PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS PCBS INTERPOSERS SUBSTRATES AND CAPACITORS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY

SUBSTITUTE ONE SUPPLIER FOR ANOTHER FROM TIME TO TIME SUPPLIERS MAY EXTEND LEAD TIMES LIMIT SUPPLY OR INCREASE PRICES DUE TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OR OTHER FACTORS ALSO SOME OF THESE MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN PRICE AND AVAILABILITY INTERRUPTION OF SUPPLY OR INCREASED DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY COULD CAUSE SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES IN VARIOUS ESSENTIAL MATERIALS DEPENDENCE ON A SOLE SUPPLIER OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS EXACERBATES THESE RISKS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCURE CERTAIN OF THESE MATERIALS FOR OUR BACK END MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR OUR THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES OR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS ARE UNABLE TO PROCURE MATERIALS FOR MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRODUCTS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME OR ALL INDUSTRY STANDARD SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH SOME OR ALL INDUSTRY STANDARD SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE FURTHER WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CORRECTING ANY SUCH COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS IN A TIMELY MANNER IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE COMPATIBILITY WITH SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION THE MERE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEM RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS COSTS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US PRODUCTS AS COMPLEX AS THOSE WE OFFER MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS OR FAILURES WHEN FIRST INTRODUCED OR WHEN NEW VERSIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT DESPITE OUR TESTING PROCEDURES ERRORS WILL NOT BE FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS OR RELEASES AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF OR DELAY IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS MATERIAL RECALL AND REPLACEMENT COSTS LOSS OF REVENUE WRITING DOWN THE INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THE DIVERSION OF THE ATTENTION OF OUR ENGINEERING PERSONNEL FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR RELATED LIABILITIES INCLUDING PROPERTY DAMAGE PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND LOSS OF DATA OR INTANGIBLE PROPERTY AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN ADDITION WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING THE END CUSTOMERS OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD AS A RESULT WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT MODIFICATIONS TO CORRECT DEFECTS ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS CAUSES OR MERELY APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED AN INJURY WHETHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE CLAIMS MAY BE MADE BY CONSUMERS OR OTHERS SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AGAINST US EVEN IF AN ALLEGED INJURY IS DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM RECALL OR OTHER CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO UNINSURED LIABILITIES OR FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AS WE RESPOND TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE PRODUCTS OUR CUSTOMERS WANT ON A TIMELY BASIS ACCORDINGLY WE RELY ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS EXPAND TO HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT MARKETS ACQUIRE NEW CUSTOMERS AND STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TEND TO HAVE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICULAR PRODUCTS AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES IN WHICH THEY REQUIRE DELIVERY OF THESE PRODUCTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER THE RIGHT PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS OUR CUSTOMERS MAY REDUCE THE QUANTITIES THEY ORDER FROM US WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD PARTIES CERTAIN SUPPLY

WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR SHORT TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WE DETERMINE OUR TOTAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE USING PROJECTIONS OF LONG TERM EXPENDITURES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW IN ADDITION THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN U S DOLLARS FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE U S DOLLAR AND THE LOCAL CURRENCY CAN CAUSE INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF SUCH CUSTOMERS AN APPRECIATION OF THE U S DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL CURRENCY COULD REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ON THE GRAY MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO OEMS AND THROUGH AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS FROM TIME TO TIME OUR PRODUCTS ARE DIVERTED FROM OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ARE SOLD ON THE GRAY MARKET GRAY

COMPLIANCE WITH AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE FOREIGN LAWS PROVIDE LESS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION THAN AFFORDED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE COMPROMISED AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WE ARE PARTY TO LITIGATION AND MAY BECOME A PARTY TO OTHER CLAIMS OR LITIGATION THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR PROHIBIT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE A DEFENDANT OR PLAINTIFF IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS CONCERNING FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OUR PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED BY AND OR USED BY CONSUMERS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION CLAIMS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN

THAT THIS ALLEGED EXPOSURE CAUSED HARM LITIGATION CAN INVOLVE COMPLEX FACTUAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS AND ITS OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF A CLAIM IS SUCCESSFULLY ASSERTED AGAINST US INCLUDING THE CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN NOTE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT COULD RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF OR THIRD PARTIES MAY BRING OR HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST US AND OR AGAINST OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CONTRIBUTING TO OR INDUCING THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS IMPROPERLY CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE

PAYMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES OR THE ENTRY OF AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE COULD DECIDE IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS OR TO RESORT TO LITIGATION TO CHALLENGE SUCH CLAIMS SUCH CHALLENGES COULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT RELEASE OR SHIPMENT AND OR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LITIGATION RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED OR SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED EVEN IF WE WERE TO PREVAIL ANY LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND WOULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX CLAIMS BY TAX AGENCIES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TAX LAWS ARE DYNAMIC AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS NEW LAWS ARE PASSED AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ARE ISSUED OR APPLIED THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE REDUCTION FROM TO THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE THE TAX REFORM ACT ALSO TRANSITIONS INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDES BASE EROSION PREVENTION MEASURES ON NON U S EARNINGS WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SUBJECTING CERTAIN EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO UNITED STATES TAXATION THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE IN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE INCOME TAX INDIRECT TAX OR OTHER TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF ANY TAX AUDITS AND LITIGATION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ASSESSMENT OR LITIGATION THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH TAX PROVISIONS AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CONFLICT MINERALS RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES OUR OPERATIONS AND PROPERTIES HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THE TREATMENT TRANSPORT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE OUR SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS FOR OPERATIONS MAKING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND WASTEWATER ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO OVERSEE OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLIANCE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IF OUR SUPPLIERS VIOLATE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THEM A RANGE OF CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT INCLUDING FINES SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION ALTERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IMPORT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SALES LIMITATIONS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES OR OTHER SANCTIONS SUCH NON COMPLIANCE FROM OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY HIGHER SOURCING COSTS AND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ARE COMPLEX CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN UNION EU AND CHINA ARE TWO AMONG A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF LEAD AND OTHER MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PACKAGING AS REGULATIONS RESTRICTING MATERIALS IN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COST QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING YIELDS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE COMPARED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR THAT THE TRANSITION TO COMPLIANT PRODUCTS MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMER ROADMAPS OR PRODUCE SUDDEN CHANGES IN DEMAND WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESS INVENTORY A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE EU AUSTRALIA CALIFORNIA AND CHINA ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE FINALIZED MARKET ENTRY OR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS FOR COMPUTERS AND SERVERS BASED ON ENERGY STAR SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION LIMITS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THESE MARKETS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE

REAL PROPERTY FOR THE COST OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY EVEN IF THE OWNER OR OPERATOR DID NOT KNOW OF OR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO ASSESS LIABILITY ON PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TO BE SENT TO DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITIES WHEN SUCH FACILITIES ARE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED SUCH PERSONS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS EVEN IF THEY NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED THE CONTAMINATED FACILITY WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT THREE SUPERFUND SITES IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WE COULD BE NAMED A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT OTHER SUPERFUND OR CONTAMINATED SITES IN THE FUTURE IN ADDITION CONTAMINATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED COULD EXIST AT OUR OTHER FACILITIES UNDER THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF THE SEC ADOPTED DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES THAT USE CONFLICT MINERALS ORIGINATING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO OR ADJOINING COUNTRIES WE CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED

STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U S GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES U S GAAP THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ON GOING BASIS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR REVENUE INVENTORIES GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALTHOUGH ACTUAL RESULTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN REASONABLY CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT S EXPECTATIONS THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES OR OUR ESTIMATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS REVENUE RECOGNITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD EFFECTIVE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON THE SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS SELL IN RATHER THAN UPON THE RESALE OF THE PRODUCT BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS SELL THROUGH

ALLOWANCES ON PRODUCT SALES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE PRICE REDUCTIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVES IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECORDED WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON ACTUAL HISTORICAL

VALUE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNT RATES AND FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IF WE CONCLUDE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT INCOME TAXES IN DETERMINING TAXABLE INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE APPLIED IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES AND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHICH ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF RECOVERY

ACCEPTABLE QUALITY AND AT ACCEPTABLE MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND TO DELIVER THOSE PRODUCTS TO US ON A TIMELY BASIS AND AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES THE MANUFACTURERS WE USE ALSO FABRICATE WAFERS AND ATMP PRODUCTS FOR OTHER COMPANIES INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITORS THEY COULD CHOOSE TO PRIORITIZE CAPACITY FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS INCREASE THE PRICES THAT THEY CHARGE US ON SHORT NOTICE OR REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DELIVERIES TO US WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS INCLUDE LIMITED CONTROL OVER DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND QUALITY ASSURANCE LACK OF CAPACITY IN PERIODS OF EXCESS DEMAND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEPENDENCE ON SEVERAL SMALL UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBCONTRACTORS AND LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE INVENTORY AND PARTS MOREOVER IF ANY OF OUR THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS SUFFER ANY DAMAGE TO FACILITIES LOSE BENEFITS UNDER MATERIAL AGREEMENTS EXPERIENCE POWER OUTAGES LACK SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS ENCOUNTER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE UNABLE TO SECURE NECESSARY RAW MATERIALS FROM THEIR SUPPLIERS OR SUFFER ANY OTHER DISRUPTION OR REDUCTION IN EFFICIENCY WE MAY ENCOUNTER SUPPLY DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT OR RELIABLE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTS OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND THIS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IF WE TRANSITION THE PRODUCTION OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS TO NEW MANUFACTURERS WE MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS LOWER YIELDS OR POORER PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IF WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH PRODUCT QUALITY OR ARE UNABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY FROM A PARTICULAR THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER OR IF WE FOR OTHER REASONS CEASE UTILIZING ONE OF THOSE SUPPLIERS WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY FOR ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT IN A SHORT TIME FRAME WE COULD EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS WE ARE PARTY TO TWO ATMP JOINT VENTURES COLLECTIVELY THE JVS WITH TONGFU FUJITSU MICROELECTRONICS CO LTD THE MAJORITY OF OUR ATMP SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY THE JVS AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE JVS WILL BE ABLE TO FULFILL OUR LONG TERM ATMP REQUIREMENTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO FLUCTUATING OR LATE SUPPLY FROM THE JVS IT COULD RESULT IN LOST SALES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS FAILURE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED MANUFACTURING YIELDS FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING YIELDS ARE A RESULT OF BOTH PRODUCT DESIGN AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS TYPICALLY PROPRIETARY TO THE MANUFACTURER AND LOW YIELDS CAN RESULT FROM DESIGN FAILURES PROCESS TECHNOLOGY FAILURES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH OUR THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES INCLUDING GF ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES USED TO FABRICATE SILICON WAFERS IF OUR THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES EXPERIENCE MANUFACTURING INEFFICIENCIES OR ENCOUNTER DISRUPTIONS ERRORS OR DIFFICULTIES DURING PRODUCTION WE MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE YIELDS OR EXPERIENCE

GENERATIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS PROFITABLY OR ON A TIMELY BASIS OR THAT OUR COMPETITORS WILL NOT DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES EARLIER MOREOVER DURING PERIODS WHEN FOUNDRIES ARE IMPLEMENTING NEW PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES MAY NOT BE FULLY PRODUCTIVE A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY IN THE TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS TO SMALLER PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US PARTICULARLY IF OUR COMPETITORS TRANSITION TO MORE COST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE US FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE PRESENTLY FOCUSING OUR NM PRODUCT PORTFOLIO ON TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR CO LTD S TSMC NM PROCESS IF TSMC IS NOT ABLE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS ON NM IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY DECREASE IN MANUFACTURING YIELDS COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN PER UNIT COSTS WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN AND OR FORCE US TO ALLOCATE OUR REDUCED PRODUCT SUPPLY AMONGST OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH COULD HARM OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS WITH FEATURES AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS THAT PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE SUPPORTING AND COINCIDING WITH SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY TRANSITIONS OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT QUALIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP QUALIFY AND DISTRIBUTE AND HAVE MANUFACTURED NEW PRODUCTS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET EVOLVING INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS AT PRICES ACCEPTABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ON A TIMELY BASIS ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING OUR COMPETITIVENESS IN OUR TARGET MARKETS AS CONSUMERS HAVE NEW PRODUCT FEATURE PREFERENCES OR HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAN THOSE CONSUMERS IN THE PC MARKET PC SALES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OUR PRODUCT ROADMAP INCLUDES OUR NEXT GENERATION AMD RYZEN AMD RADEON AND AMD EPYC PROCESSORS USING NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR EFFORTS TO EXECUTE OUR PRODUCT ROADMAP WILL RESULT IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IF WE FAIL TO OR ARE DELAYED IN DEVELOPING QUALIFYING OR SHIPPING NEW PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ADDRESS THESE NEW TRENDS OR IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT WHICH NEW FORM FACTORS CONSUMERS WILL ADOPT AND ADJUST OUR BUSINESS ACCORDINGLY WE MAY LOSE COMPETITIVE POSITIONING WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE AND REQUIRE US TO DISCOUNT THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OBTAIN OR SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR THAT THEY WILL BE WELL RECEIVED BY OUR CUSTOMERS MOREOVER OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVE CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND COULD DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS NEW INVESTMENTS MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND MAY DIVERT OUR LIMITED RESOURCES AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT FROM OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WILL MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS AND WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DELAYS IN DEVELOPING QUALIFYING OR SHIPPING NEW PRODUCTS CAN ALSO CAUSE US TO MISS OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCT DESIGN WINDOWS OR IN SOME CASES BREACH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR CAUSE US TO PAY PENALTIES IF OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT INCLUDE OUR PRODUCTS IN THE INITIAL DESIGN OF THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS OR PRODUCTS THEY WILL TYPICALLY NOT USE OUR PRODUCTS IN THEIR SYSTEMS OR PRODUCTS UNTIL AT LEAST THE NEXT DESIGN CONFIGURATION THE PROCESS OF BEING QUALIFIED FOR INCLUSION IN A CUSTOMER S SYSTEM OR PRODUCT CAN BE LENGTHY AND COULD CAUSE US TO FURTHER MISS A CYCLE IN THE DEMAND OF END USERS WHICH ALSO COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF MARKET SHARE AND HARM OUR BUSINESS WE ALSO DEPEND ON THE SUCCESS AND TIMING OF OUR CUSTOMERS PLATFORM LAUNCHES IF OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY THEIR PRODUCT LAUNCHES OR IF OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MARKET THEIR PLATFORMS WITH OUR PRODUCTS IT COULD RESULT IN A DELAY IN BRINGING OUR PRODUCTS TO MARKET AND CAUSE US TO MISS A CYCLE IN THE DEMAND OF END USERS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN ADDITION MARKET DEMAND REQUIRES THAT PRODUCTS INCORPORATE NEW FEATURES AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ON AN INDUSTRY WIDE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF A SPECIFIC PRODUCT THE SALE PRICE IS TYPICALLY REDUCED OVER TIME THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OVERALL CORPORATE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS WITH SUFFICIENTLY HIGH SALE PRICES OR TO INCREASE UNIT SALES VOLUMES CAPABLE OF OFFSETTING THE REDUCTIONS IN THE SALE PRICES OF EXISTING PRODUCTS OVER TIME OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE CANNOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN EXTERNAL FINANCING WE MAY FACE A CASH SHORTFALL AND BE UNABLE TO MAKE ALL OF OUR PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS OUR ABILITY TO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DEPENDS ON GENERATING SUFFICIENT REVENUE AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTERNAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOGETHER WITH ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL DRAIN ON OUR CASH FLOW AND MAY DECREASE OUR CASH BALANCES IF NEW COMPETITORS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BY EXISTING COMPETITORS OR OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN ANTICIPATED IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD INCREASE IF WE ARE

OF OUR SALES MAY BE WEIGHTED DIFFERENTLY DURING THE YEAR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR QUARTERLY SALES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MADE IN THE LAST MONTH OF THE QUARTER THIS UNEVEN SALES PATTERN MAKES PREDICTION OF REVENUE FOR EACH FINANCIAL PERIOD DIFFICULT AND INCREASES THE RISK OF UNANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ADDITION OUR OPERATING RESULTS TEND TO VARY SEASONALLY WITH THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FOR EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY FIRST QUARTER PC PRODUCT SALES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND WITH RESPECT TO OUR SEMI CUSTOM SOC PRODUCTS

FOR WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE AND OTHER PURPOSES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES REQUIRE US TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO MAKE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH RELATIVELY LESS DEBT AND INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS WE ENTER INTO SALE AND FACTORING

SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS WHEREBY A DEFAULT UNDER ONE AGREEMENT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN CROSS DEFAULTS UNDER AGREEMENTS COVERING OTHER BORROWINGS FOR EXAMPLE THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR ANY FAILURE TO REPAY DEBT WHEN DUE IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF MILLION WOULD CAUSE A CROSS DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURES TO THE EXTENT SUCH

REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY THOSE BORROWINGS THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND DELIVERING THE LATEST AND BEST PRODUCTS TO MARKET ON A TIMELY BASIS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING REVENUE GROWTH WE BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE OUR PRODUCT COMPETITIVENESS ARE TIMELY PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRODUCT QUALITY PRODUCT FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES INCLUDING ENABLING STATE OF THE ART VISUAL AND VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCLUDING POWER CONSUMPTION AND BATTERY LIFE RELIABILITY PROCESSOR CLOCK SPEED PERFORMANCE SIZE OR FORM FACTOR SELLING PRICE COST ADHERENCE TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CREATION OF OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY SECURITY AND STABILITY BRAND RECOGNITION AND AVAILABILITY WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTENSE DUE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS OR NEW COMPETITORS OF PRODUCTS THAT MAY PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE OR MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS UNCOMPETITIVE WE MAY ALSO FACE AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY COMPETITORS ESPECIALLY DURING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IN ADDITION OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AND SALES RESOURCES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN SUCH A DECLINING MARKET LEADING TO LOWER PRICES AND MARGINS SOME COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER ACCESS OR RIGHTS TO COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING INTERFACE PROCESSOR AND MEMORY TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE WITH OUR APU PRODUCTS AND OTHER COMPETING SOLUTIONS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DISCRETE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND CARDS MAY DECREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS IF COMPETITORS INTRODUCE COMPETITIVE NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET BEFORE US DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ADDITION INTEL CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POSITION IN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FOR THE PC MARKET WITH HIGH END DISCRETE GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING SEGMENTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THESE COMPUTING SEGMENTS IN ADDITION WE ARE ENTERING MARKETS WITH CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR NEW COMPETITORS WHO MAY HAVE STRONGER POSITIONS IN THESE NEW MARKETS OR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND EMERGING INDUSTRY TRENDS WE MAY FACE DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAN ANTICIPATED OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US WE MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

OPERATED BY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHINA MALAYSIA AND TAIWAN WE ALSO HAVE INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS INTERNATIONAL SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE WERE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION EXPROPRIATION CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY S OR REGION S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR

MEASLES OR EBOLA SAFETY ISSUES NATURAL DISASTERS FIRE DISRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS OR GENERAL ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED KINGDOM S REFERENDUM COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BREXIT HAS CREATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ALSO THE EUROPEAN UNION S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE COLLECT PROCESS AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON COMPLIANCE ALSO THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR CHANGES TO DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS ON OUR BUSINESS AND AMD PROCESSOR BASED PRODUCTS THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES CHINA OR OTHER COUNTRIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS ANY OF THE ABOVE RISKS SHOULD THEY OCCUR COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS PRODUCTION DELAYS GENERAL BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS DELAYS FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING EXPORT LICENSES FOR CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY TARIFFS AND OTHER BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES INCREASED TAXES RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPATRIATION OF FUNDS AND THE BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS ANY OF WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS THE CONVERSION OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR MAY OTHERWISE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE CONVERSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES MAY DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS THE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE SALE PRICE FOR CONVERSION WAS SATISFIED AS OF THE END OF MARCH AND AS A RESULT THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION DURING THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER OF ANY SALES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON SUCH CONVERSION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN ADDITION THE EXISTENCE OF THE NOTES MAY ENCOURAGE SHORT SELLING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE THE CONVERSION THEREOF COULD BE USED TO SATISFY SHORT POSITIONS OR THE ANTICIPATED

PLAYSTATION SONY PLAYSTATION PRO MICROSOFT XBOX ONE S AND MICROSOFT XBOX ONE X GAME CONSOLE SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE IN ADDITION THE GPU MARKET HAS AT TIMES SEEN ELEVATED DEMAND DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF GPU PRODUCTS TO CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING FOR EXAMPLE OUR GPU REVENUE HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN PART BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET DEMAND FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS CHANGED AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE QUICKLY FOR EXAMPLE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE INSTITUTED RESTRICTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING AND THE VALUATIONS OF THE CURRENCIES AND CORRESPONDING INTEREST IN MINING OF SUCH CURRENCIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE RISKS RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MARKET OUR GPU BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

INVENTORY OF OUR PRODUCTS AGAINST PRICE REDUCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS THE PRICE PROTECTION RIGHTS WE OFFER WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE OUR REVENUE AND CORRESPONDING GROSS MARGIN WOULD DECLINE WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL AND TECHNOLOGY LICENSE PURCHASES WE PERFORM OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR SUBSEQUENT TO OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS WE MONITOR FOR ANY EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE OR OPERATING RESULTS CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT S BUSINESS STRATEGY AN INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE AN INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE INTERNAL FORECASTS OR

CERTAIN THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS FOR THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS WE REPORT THE VALUE OF THOSE LICENSES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE LICENSES BASED ON THEIR FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO US FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIFE OF THE ASSETS CHANGES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES AND CHANGES TO THE BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY REPRESENT AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO RECORD FUTURE TECHNOLOGY LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN COST OF SALES OF MILLION ON TECHNOLOGY LICENSES RELATED TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NO LONGER BEING USED OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL MAY HINDER OUR BUSINESS MUCH OF OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF NUMEROUS QUALIFIED ENGINEERING MARKETING SALES AND EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL COMPETITION FOR HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND OUR COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OUR EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE DESIRED SKILLS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TRAIN AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL NECESSARY FOR OUR BUSINESS THE PROGRESS OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS COULD BE HINDERED AND WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO HELP ATTRACT RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WE USE SHARE BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND NON VESTED SHARE UNITS RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR IF OUR SHARE BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT RETAIN AND MOTIVATE PERSONNEL COULD BE WEAKENED WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO IF THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK AWARDS INCREASES SUBSTANTIALLY THIS COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE GREAT PERSONAL WEALTH FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN THESE EMPLOYEES IN ADDITION ANY FUTURE RESTRUCTURING PLANS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AS REQUIRED BY THE APPLICABLE INDENTURES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURES AND OUR SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF

BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONSTANT AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONTINUOUS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS PRICE EROSION AND DECLINES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN RECENT DOWNTURNS DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMBALANCES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR END USER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PCS THAT INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS AND EXCESS INVENTORY LEVELS INDUSTRY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPUTER MARKETPLACE HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED US IN THE PAST AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS REVENUE IS FOCUSED ON CONSUMER DESKTOP PC AND NOTEBOOK SEGMENTS WHILE OVERALL GROWTH IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS STABILIZING THE AREAS WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS ARE CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS IS BASED ON FORESEEING THOSE CHANGES AND MAKING TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM FACTORS THAT SERVE THOSE GROWING SUB SEGMENTS GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKNESS HAVE IN THE PAST IMPACTED THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED PURCHASES WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THESE DOWNTURNS THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM HIGH GROWTH ADJACENT EMERGING GLOBAL MARKETS OUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SUCH MARKETS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE AND MAINTAIN LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKETS IF DEMAND FROM THESE MARKETS IS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US ACQUISITIONS DIVESTITURES AND OR JOINT VENTURES COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OR DILUTE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND GROW OUR BUSINESS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES SOLUTIONS OR TECHNOLOGIES OR THROUGH DIVESTITURES OR JOINT VENTURES RATHER THAN THROUGH INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE CANDIDATES CAN BE DIFFICULT TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IDENTIFIED ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES MOREOVER IF SUCH
